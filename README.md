Video conferencing website 


You can check out my website from this link
https://agile-nexus.herokuapp.com/



I have named this website Agile Nexus because i tried to follow the Agile Model through this project. As WebRTC provides real time communication and the api's are very easy to use hence i have used WebRTC with google turn serve and numb stun server for this project.


This Website Ui is very user friendly anyone can visit my website and access it without facing any difficulties some functionalities and features are mentioned on the first page only. 

I have added some notifications sounds as well to give user a better experience.

Here we consider your privacy and security first. You can check privacy policy section there you can find out all the links and all the other stuff that ensures your security and privacy. This website has no intension of using your personal data. As soon as you leave the conference room all your data would automatically deleted from our server and we take only that much of user information that is required to make a successful call.


I have used ngrok for the testing purposes.
